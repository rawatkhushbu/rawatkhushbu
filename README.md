🚀 About Me

I am a passionate data science and machine learning enthusiast with strong hands-on experience in Python, SQL, ML, and Generative AI. I enjoy building end‑to‑end projects—from data preprocessing and model training to deployment. I am currently preparing for campus placements and actively working on improving my technical and communication skills.

I believe in learning by building, and my GitHub reflects real, practical projects rather than just theory.
